# Theer

**A simple and beautiful Hugo theme based on GitHub's [Primer][]**

This theme would be a perfect fit if you are used to GitHub style pages. It's
based on GitHub's Primer CSS, and adds some blog-specific features like tags,
categories, and support for an external search API.

Try it now, and leave me a star if you like it!
